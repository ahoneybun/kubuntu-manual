@section What is Linux?


Linux is an operating system kernel that resembles the Unix operating system. The kernel is the main software required for any operating system, providing a communication bridge between hardware and software. Linux has become a leading element of the worldwide movement to embrace free and open source software. The term "GNU/Linux" is a way of referring to operating systems based on the Linux kernel combined with parts from the GNU Project@footnote{http://www.gnu.org}.

Microsoft Windows does not have any built-in tools for MD5SUM but they do
provide some decent documentation@footnote{https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/841290} and a tool for checking the MD5SUM. How-To-Geek also provides some reading material@footnote{http://www.howtogeek.com/67241/htg-explains-what-are-md5-sha-1-hashes-and-how-do-i-check-them/} if you want to understand the technology behind MD5SUM if you like.

@subsubsection From Mac OS X


Open the Terminal app, then navigate to the directory where the ISO is saved.
Run:

@example
md5 -r kubuntu-17.04-desktop-amd64.iso
@end example

And compare the output to the hashes page for the ISO file.

The first thing to do is to make sure you're in the directory with the .iso file (most likely in the Downloads directory). For more complex use of MD5SUM check this out@footnote{https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM}. Then running the command 'md5sum':

@example
md5sum kubuntu-17.04-desktop-amd64.iso

@item 
Your computer is connected to the Internet so that you can download updates and third-party software as Kubuntu is installing.
@end itemize

@image{prepare,,,,png}

Include this third-party software: includes software that either does not follow the Open Source model or the Ubuntu Philosophy@footnote{http://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu/our-philosophy}, but is safe for use on your system.

Download updates while installing: will ensure that you have the latest bug and security fixes included and applied once the installation is complete.

The following sections are some possible installation scenarios you might choose. Each of these choices points to a page or series of pages with more details.

@image{disksetup-manual,,,,png}

When using Manual to set up your system as you would like it, keep these thoughts in mind:


@itemize -

@item 
The root ( / ) directory needs at least 25 GBs of space.

@item 
The home ( /home ) directory needs as much space as you will need for your files, music, pictures and documents.
So it is best to use the remaining space for the home partition, unless you have going to dual boot.

@item 
Swap space of at least half of the available RAM is recommended. For instance, with 8 GBs, make the swap with at least 4 GBs.
@end itemize

@cartouche
@quotation Note 
If you have a Windows 8 sticker on your machine you might need to make a separate EFI partition with a fat32 filesystem.

@subsection Timezone


During this step you get to pick the Region where you live and then the Timezone of the location in that Region. An example would be that I live in New York, so my Region is North America and my Timezone is New York.

This is the step that will set up your keyboard's language and, if the language has it, a different version of the language. For example, there is a Cherokee American English setting as well as different setups with special keys used in certain countries; in Kubuntu we try to make the system easy for everyone!

@image{Kickoff-zesty,,,,png}

As a @emph{KDE} distribution, Kubuntu uses the Kickoff Application Launcher by default. The Kickoff Launcher can be compared with the 'Start Menu' in Windows (pre Windows 8). The icon to launch Kickoff is on the bottom left very much like Windows XP or 7. For more information on how to use and customize it, see Plasma Kickoff@footnote{https://userbase.kde.org/Special:MyLanguage/Plasma/Kickoff}.

@node Wireless,,Wired,Networking
@anchor{docs/basic wireless}@anchor{37}
@subsection Wireless


Most Wireless cards are supported out of the box by Kubuntu. However, in some cases the Wireless network device may have a restricted driver in order to operate. The best way to check this is to open the 'Driver Manager'. To open this program use 'KickOff' -> 'System Settings' -> 'Driver Manager'. If the device needs a restricted driver, then 'Driver Manager' can help with selecting, installing, and activating the proper driver. Once this is all handled, the system will need to be rebooted. For more information on troubleshooting Wi-Fi on your system, see Wireless troubleshooting@footnote{https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessTroubleShootingGuide}.

@node Deskop Customization,Updating,Networking,Basic
@anchor{docs/basic deskop-customization}@anchor{38}
@section Deskop Customization


This section covers the basics of configuring Kubuntu to suit your needs. One of the strengths of the @emph{KDE} philosophy is the focus on control of just about every aspect of the desktop environment. Wallpapers, themes, widgets, color schemes, splash screens, and more; the options for customization are endless.

KDE-Look is the number one location to find customized settings for the @emph{KDE} Plasma desktop. Some of the applications even allow direct connections to KDE-Look to download a new configuration or image.

@subsection Activities


Activites are specific and exclusive to KDE. As such they're often under utilised and misunderstood. In this section we're going to explore what KDE Activities are, how to set them up, and how to use them.

Think for a moment about your average day working on your PC. It will often traverse different activities. For example doing email and researching things on the internet, perhaps developing some documents, working on a piece of software, writing your thesis in LaTeX etc...

Commonly KDE users might use Virtual desktops to seperate these workspaces.

KDE Activites in Kubuntu provide a slick way to setup and configure environments specific to your task routines. For example your might want to have your email, and social networks configured as one activity. Perhaps your research, and writing for your thesis configured as another activity.

@image{activity_desktop_side_bar,,,,png}

Let's take a look at the default KDE Activities configured in Kubuntu. Right Click anywhere on the empty desktop and choose "Activities" from the menu. The Activities side bar appears on the left, with the Default activity. Notice the + Create Activity at the bottom. Click that, and lets created a new "Social" Activity.
Enter "Social" as the Activity name: and then click Create.

That's it you have created your first activity.

You can theme, and configured this new activity desktop in the same ways as mentioned early in this section of the manual.

OK, looking good, lets create another activity. Call this one "News". Once created switch to this activity, either by Right Click on the Desktop > Activities or use the Keyboard shortcut Alt+D,A ( Hold Alt down, press D, then Press A )
Then select the News activity from the side bar.

OK, lets configure a few useful tools

Kubuntu developers release feature and security updates for applications and packages within the Kubuntu system. When updates become available, Kubuntu will display a message in the System Tray. To update the system, open Discover from either the Application Menu or Krunner and click the Update button (usually yellow/orange when there are updates). After installing some updates, it may be necessary to restart the computer. If so, Kubuntu will display a pop-up and an icon in the System Tray.

There are several ways to manage applications in Kubuntu. A convenient way to add or remove applications is with a package manager.

@anchor{docs/advanced graphical-clients}@anchor{45}
@subsection Graphical Clients


By default Kubuntu comes with a great package manager called Discover. Discover is an advanced program with a graphical user interface (GUI) for installing and removing applications. It will automatically notify you for updates (in the lower right hand corner), but you can use it at anytime to install new packages by going to KickOff and type . Select  Discover from the results. If you prefer the Ubuntu-style "Software Center" you will need to install it from within Discover.

@image{Discover-zesty,,,,png}

Discover might provide information about required dependencies, these are other packages (programs) that the piece of software that you want to install needs to run. Once this information is acknowledged, the required packages will begin downloading. When the installation process is complete, the software will be ready to use. It is rarely necessary to restart the system after software installation or updates. If it is, the system will warn you and give you a restart icon to do the restart at your convenience.

Discover also provides an easy method to remove software that is no longer needed.

@node Repositories,PPAs Personal Package Archive,Graphical Clients,Software Management
@anchor{docs/advanced repositories}@anchor{46}
@subsection Repositories


Thousands of programs are freely available to install in Kubuntu. These programs are stored in software archives ("repositories") and are made available for installation over the Internet. Installing new programs in Kubuntu is quick, reliable, and secure because each program is built specifically for Kubuntu and is checked thoroughly before it is made available. Kubuntu repositories are categorized into four groups:


@itemize -

@item 
Main

@item 
Restricted

@item 
Universe

@item 
Multiverse
@end itemize

Two factors are used to determine categories


@itemize -

@item 
The level of support provided for a program by its software development teams.

@item 
The level of compliance the program has to the Ubuntu Free Software Philosophy@footnote{http://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu/our-philosophy}.
@end itemize

The standard Kubuntu LiveDVD contains some software from the "Main" and "Restricted" categories. Once a system has information about the Internet-based locations for these repositories, more programs are available for installation. Using the software package management tools installed by default, it is possible to discover, install, and update any piece of software directly over the internet without the need for the LiveDVD.

@subsection PPAs (Personal Package Archive)


Personal Package Archives allow any person in the Ubuntu community who has committed to observe the Ubuntu Code of Conduct@footnote{https://launchpad.net/codeofconduct} to upload Ubuntu source packages to be built and published as an apt repository by Launchpad. Software from Launchpad's Personal Package Archive@footnote{https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas} (PPA) requires a GnuPG@footnote{https://www.gnupg.org/} (GPG) key so your system can verify that it's getting the packages from the correct source and that the packages have not been interfered with since they were built. GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage.

For more information about PPAs, see Managing Personal Package Archives@footnote{https://userbase.kde.org/Kubuntu/Advanced/Repositories#Managing_Personal_Package_Archives}.

@node Install/Uninstall ' deb' files,,PPAs Personal Package Archive,Software Management
@anchor{docs/advanced install-uninstall-deb-files}@anchor{48}
@subsection Install/Uninstall '.deb' files


The package files associated with Kubuntu have the ".deb" suffix because of Kubuntu's close relationship with the Debian GNU/Linux distribution. Individual ".deb" files can be downloaded and installed. Humble Bundles, for instance, distribute debs. Administrative privileges are required.

@end menu

@node Install from Source,,,Install/Uninstall ' deb' files
@anchor{docs/advanced install-from-source}@anchor{49}
@subsubsection Install from Source


Files with the .tar.gz or .tar.bz2 suffix are package files known as "tarballs" or "source" packages. These are widely used in Linux. If there is no native Kubuntu package available in any of the repositories, it may be possible to compile and install the package from source. For tips on compiling software, look at the Compiling Software@footnote{https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingSoftware} page on the Ubuntu Wiki.

@node Drivers,,Software Management,Advanced
@anchor{docs/advanced drivers}@anchor{4a}
@section Drivers


On every Operating System (Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux) there are programs called Drivers which you install on your computer. These Drivers let your computer use new hardware or existing hardware, like Wifi@footnote{https://userbase.kde.org/Kubuntu/Basic#Wireless}. There Drivers also cover your graphics card e.g NVIDIA, AMD, sometimes the nonfree or restricted drivers let the cards perform better than the free ones. The Driver Manager handles installing and uninstalling these for you. These improvements may cover gaming, video editing and processing to image editing.

Providing support is an awesome way to give back to the community because it is not required to have advanced skills or know everything about Linux or Kubuntu. You'll actually end up learning more as you help others, which increases your own knowledge and skills. This can be a gateway to learning other things, from bug triaging to packaging, and perhaps even to programming. Also, it is quite rewarding to fix the system of someone who is on the other side of the world!

You can give support and get it in the IRC channels, through the Kubuntu Users Mailing List@footnote{https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/kubuntu-users}, or through the Kubuntu Forums@footnote{https://www.kubuntuforums.net/content.php}, Ubuntu Forums@footnote{http://ubuntuforums.org/}, and KDE Forums@footnote{https://forum.kde.org/}.

@subsection 2. Getting Set Up


There are a number of things you need to do to get started developing for Kubuntu. This article is designed to get your computer set up so that you can start working with packages, and upload your packages to Kubuntu’s hosting platform, Launchpad. Here’s what we’ll cover:
Installing packaging-related software. This includes:

Kubuntu-specific packaging utilities

Encryption software so your work can be verified as being done by you
Additional encryption software so you can securely transfer files
Creating and configuring your account on Launchpad
Setting up your development environment to help you do local builds of packages, interact with other developers, and propose your changes on Launchpad.
Note
It is advisable to do packaging work using the current development version of Kubuntu. Doing so will allow you to test changes in the same environment where those changes will actually be applied and used.
Don’t worry though, you can use Testdrive or chroots to safely use the development release.

@subsubsection 2.1. Install basic packaging software


There are a number of tools that will make your life as an Kubuntu developer much easier. You will encounter these tools later in this guide. To install most of the tools you will need run this command:
$ sudo apt-get install gnupg pbuilder ubuntu-dev-tools bzr-builddeb apt-file

Note: Since Kubuntu 11.10 “Oneiric Ocelot” (or if you have Backports enabled on a currently supported release), the following command will install the above and other tools which are quite common in Kubuntu development:
$ sudo apt-get install packaging-dev

This command will install the following software:


@itemize *

@item 
gnupg – GNU Privacy Guard contains tools you will need to create a cryptographic key with which you will sign files you want to upload to Launchpad.

@item 
pbuilder – a tool to do reproducible builds of a package in a clean and isolated environment.

@item 
ubuntu-dev-tools (and devscripts, a direct dependency) – a collection of tools that make many packaging tasks easier.

@item 
bzr-builddeb (and bzr, a dependency) – distributed version control with Bazaar, a new way of working with packages for Kubuntu that will make it easy for many developers to collaborate and work on the same code while keeping it trivial to merge each other’s work.

@item 
apt-file provides an easy way to find the binary package that contains a given file.
@end itemize

@node 2 1 1 Create your GPG key,2 1 2 Create your SSH key,2 1 Install basic packaging software,2 Getting Set Up
@anchor{docs/packaging_guide/getting_started create-your-gpg-key}@anchor{8a}
@subsubsection 2.1.1. Create your GPG key


GPG stands for GNU Privacy Guard and it implements the OpenPGP standard which allows you to sign and encrypt messages and files. This is useful for a number of purposes. In our case it is important that you can sign files with your key so they can be identified as something that you worked on. If you upload a source package to Launchpad, it will only accept the package if it can absolutely determine who uploaded the package.
To generate a new GPG key, run:

@example
$ gpg --gen-key
@end example

GPG will first ask you which kind of key you want to generate. Choosing the default (RSA and DSA) is fine. Next it will ask you about the keysize. The default (currently 2048) is fine, but 4096 is more secure. Afterwards, it will ask you if you want it to expire the key at some stage. It is safe to say “0”, which means the key will never expire. The last questions will be about your name and email address. Just pick the ones you are going to use for Kubuntu development here, you can add additional email addresses later on. Adding a comment is not necessary. Then you will have to set a passphrase, choose a safe one (a passphrase is just a password which is allowed to include spaces).
Now GPG will create a key for you, which can take a little bit of time; it needs random bytes, so if you give the system some work to do it will be just fine. Move the cursor around, type some paragraphs of random text, load some web page.
Once this is done, you will get a message similar to this one:

@example
pub   4096R/43CDE61D 2010-12-06
      Key fingerprint = 5C28 0144 FB08 91C0 2CF3  37AC 6F0B F90F 43CD E61D
uid   Daniel Holbach <dh@@mailempfang.de>
sub   4096R/51FBE68C 2010-12-06
@end example

In this case 43CDE61D is the key ID.
Next, you need to upload the public part of your key to a keyserver so the world can identify messages and files as yours. To do so, enter:

@example
$ gpg --send-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com <KEY ID>
@end example

This will send your key to the Ubuntu keyserver, but a network of keyservers will automatically sync the key between themselves. Once this syncing is complete, your signed public key will be ready to verify your contributions around the world.

@anchor{docs/packaging_guide/getting_started create-your-ssh-key}@anchor{8b}
@subsubsection 2.1.2. Create your SSH key


SSH stands for Secure Shell, and it is a protocol that allows you to exchange data in a secure way over a network. It is common to use SSH to access and open a shell on another computer, and to use it to securely transfer files. For our purposes, we will mainly be using SSH to securely upload source packages to Launchpad.
To generate an SSH key, enter:

@example
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
@end example

The default file name usually makes sense, so you can just leave it as it is. For security purposes, it is highly recommended that you use a passphrase.

@anchor{docs/packaging_guide/getting_started set-up-pbuilder}@anchor{8c}
@subsubsection 2.1.3. Set up pbuilder


pbuilder allows you to build packages locally on your machine. It serves a couple of purposes:
The build will be done in a minimal and clean environment. This helps you make sure your builds succeed in a reproducible way, but without modifying your local system
There is no need to install all necessary build dependencies locally
You can set up multiple instances for various Kubuntu and Debian releases
Setting pbuilder up is very easy, run:

@example
$ pbuilder-dist <release> create
@end example

where <release> is for example raring, saucy, trusty or in the case of Debian maybe sid. This will take a while as it will download all the necessary packages for a “minimal installation”. These will be cached though.

@subsubsection 2.2.1. About Launchpad


Launchpad is the central piece of infrastructure we use in Kubuntu. It not only stores our packages and our code, but also things like translations, bug reports, and information about the people who work on Kubuntu and their team memberships. You will also use Launchpad to publish your proposed fixes, and get other Kubuntu developers to review and sponsor them.
You will need to register with Launchpad and provide a minimal amount of information. This will allow you to download and upload code, submit bug reports, and more.
Besides hosting Kubuntu, Launchpad can host any Free Software project. For more information see the Launchpad Help wiki.

@node 2 2 2 Get a Launchpad account,2 2 3 Upload your GPG key to Launchpad,2 2 1 About Launchpad,2 2 Get set up to work with Launchpad
@anchor{docs/packaging_guide/getting_started get-a-launchpad-account}@anchor{8f}
@subsubsection 2.2.2. Get a Launchpad account


If you don’t already have a Launchpad account, you can easily create one. If you have a Launchpad account but cannot remember your Launchpad id, you can find this out by going to @indicateurl{https://launchpad.net/~} and looking for the part after the ~ in the URL.
Launchpad’s registration process will ask you to choose a display name. It is encouraged for you to use your real name here so that your Kubuntu developer colleagues will be able to get to know you better.
When you register a new account, Launchpad will send you an email with a link you need to open in your browser in order to verify your email address. If you don’t receive it, check in your spam folder.
The new account help page on Launchpad has more information about the process and additional settings you can change.

@node 2 2 3 Upload your GPG key to Launchpad,2 2 4 Upload your SSH key to Launchpad,2 2 2 Get a Launchpad account,2 2 Get set up to work with Launchpad
@anchor{docs/packaging_guide/getting_started upload-your-gpg-key-to-launchpad}@anchor{90}
@subsubsection 2.2.3. Upload your GPG key to Launchpad


First, you will need to get your fingerprint and key ID.
To find about your GPG fingerprint, run:

@example
$ gpg --fingerprint email@@address.com
@end example

and it will print out something like:

@example
pub   4096R/43CDE61D 2010-12-06
      Key fingerprint = 5C28 0144 FB08 91C0 2CF3  37AC 6F0B F90F 43CD E61D
uid   Daniel Holbach <dh@@mailempfang.de>
sub   4096R/51FBE68C 2010-12-06
@end example

Then run this command to submit your key to Ubuntu keyserver:

@example
$ gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --send-keys 43CDE61D
@end example

where 43CDE61D should be replaced by your key ID (which is in the first line of output of the previous command). Now you can import your key to Launchpad.

Head to @indicateurl{https://launchpad.net/~/+editpgpkeys} and copy the “Key fingerprint” into the text box.

In the case above this would be 5C28 0144 FB08 91C0 2CF3  37AC 6F0B F90F 43CD E61D.
Now click on “Import Key”.

Launchpad will use the fingerprint to check the Ubuntu key server for your key and, if successful, send you an encrypted email asking you to confirm the key import. Check your email account and read the email that Launchpad sent you. If your email client supports OpenPGP encryption, it will prompt you for the password you chose for the key when GPG generated it. Enter the password, then click the link to confirm that the key is yours.
Launchpad encrypts the email, using your public key, so that it can be sure that the key is yours. If you are using Thunderbird, the default Ubuntu email client, you can install the Enigmail plugin to easily decrypt the message. If your email software does not support OpenPGP encryption, copy the encrypted email’s contents, type gpg in your terminal, then paste the email contents into your terminal window.
Back on the Launchpad website, use the Confirm button and Launchpad will complete the import of your OpenPGP key.

Find more information at @indicateurl{https://help.launchpad.net/YourAccount/ImportingYourPGPKey}

@anchor{docs/packaging_guide/getting_started upload-your-ssh-key-to-launchpad}@anchor{91}
@subsubsection 2.2.4. Upload your SSH key to Launchpad


Open @indicateurl{https://launchpad.net/~/+editsshkeys} in a web browser, also open ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub in a text editor. This is the public part of your SSH key, so it is safe to share it with Launchpad. Copy the contents of the file and paste them into the text box on the web page that says “Add an SSH key”. Now click “Import Public Key”.
For more information on this process, visit the creating an SSH keypair page on Launchpad.

@anchor{docs/packaging_guide/getting_started configure-bazaar}@anchor{92}
@subsubsection 2.2.5. Configure Bazaar


Bazaar is the tool we use to store code changes in a logical way, to exchange proposed changes and merge them, even if development is done concurrently. It is used for the new Kubuntu Distributed Development method of working with Kubuntu packages.
To tell Bazaar who you are, simply run:

@example
$ bzr whoami "Bob Dobbs <subgenius@@example.com>"
$ bzr launchpad-login subgenius
@end example

whoami will tell Bazaar which name and email address it should use for your commit messages. With launchpad-loginyou set your Launchpad ID. This way code that you publish in Launchpad will be associated with you.
Note: If you can not remember the ID, go to @indicateurl{https://launchpad.net/~} and see where it redirects you. The part after the “~” in the URL is your Launchpad ID.)

@node 2 2 6 Configure your shell,,2 2 5 Configure Bazaar,2 2 Get set up to work with Launchpad
@anchor{docs/packaging_guide/getting_started configure-your-shell}@anchor{93}
@subsubsection 2.2.6. Configure your shell


Similar to Bazaar, the Debian/Kubuntu packaging tools need to learn about you as well. Simply open your ~/.bashrc in a text editor and add something like this to the bottom of it:

@example
export DEBFULLNAME="Bob Dobbs"
export DEBEMAIL="subgenius@@example.com"
@end example

Now save the file and either restart your terminal or run:

@example
$ source ~/.bashrc
@end example

(If you do not use the default shell, which is bash, please edit the configuration file for that shell accordingly.)
