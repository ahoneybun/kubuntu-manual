Managing Personal Package Archives
-----------------------------------

Personal Package Archives allow any person in the Ubuntu community who has committed to observe the `Ubuntu Code of Conduct <https://launchpad.net/codeofconduct>`_ to upload Ubuntu source packages to be built and published as an apt repository by Launchpad. Software from Launchpad's `Personal Package Archive <https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas>`_ (PPA) requires a `GnuPG <https://www.gnupg.org/>`_ (GPG) key so your system can verify that it's getting the packages from the correct source and that the packages have not been interfered with since they were built. GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage.

**Important**: The contents of Personal Package Archives are not checked or monitored. You install software from them at your own risk.
