    <para>
      As a <emphasis>KDE</emphasis> distribution, Kubuntu uses the
      Kickoff Application Launcher by default. The Kickoff Launcher can
      be compared with the <quote>Start Menu</quote> in Windows (pre
      Windows 8). The icon to launch Kickoff is on the bottom left very
      much like Windows XP or 7. For more information on how to use and
      customize it, see
      <ulink url="https://userbase.kde.org/Special:MyLanguage/Plasma/Kickoff">Plasma

      Taken from the old Plasma Netbook interface we have the

      Netbooks or small laptops.

    <para>
      Like Kickoff, KRunner is a launcher, but it does a lot more than
      just launching applications. Usually KRunner is accessed by
      pressing Alt + Space. For more information on what it can do, see
      <ulink url="https://userbase.kde.org/Special:MyLanguage/Plasma/Krunner">Plasma

    <title>Wired</title>
    <para>
      In most cases the wired network connection will simply work
      without any changes to the default Kubuntu configuration. Wired
      network connections are selected as default when they are
      available.
    </para>
  </sect2>
  <sect2 id="wireless">
    <title>Wireless</title>
    <para>
      Most Wireless cards are supported out of the box by Kubuntu.
      However, in some cases the Wireless network device may have a
      restricted driver in order to operate. The best way to check this
      is to open the <quote>Driver Manager</quote>. To open this program
      use <quote>KickOff</quote> -&gt; <quote>System Settings</quote>
      -&gt; <quote>Driver Manager</quote>. If the device needs a
      restricted driver, then <quote>Driver Manager</quote> can help
      with selecting, installing, and activating the proper driver. Once
      this is all handled, the system will need to be rebooted. For more
      information on troubleshooting Wi-Fi on your system, see

  <title>Deskop Customization</title>
  <para>
    This section covers the basics of configuring Kubuntu to suit your
    needs. One of the strengths of the <emphasis>KDE</emphasis>
    philosophy is the focus on control of just about every aspect of the
    desktop environment. Wallpapers, themes, widgets, color schemes,
    splash screens, and more; the options for customization are endless.
  </para>
  <para>
    KDE-Look is the number one location to find customized settings for
    the <emphasis>KDE</emphasis> Plasma desktop. Some of the
    applications even allow direct connections to KDE-Look to download a
    new configuration or image.
  </para>
  <sect2 id="themes">
    <title>Themes</title>
    <para>
      Kubuntu allows themes to be changed easily. To change your theme
      go to System Settings -&gt; Workspace Theme in the Desktop Theme
      section, then choose from the list of installed themes. You can
      change the theme of the Desktop Theme, Cursor Theme, and the
      Splash Screen. Pick from the default choices that are installed,
      or left-click the <quote>Get New…</quote> button in each section
      for more choices.

    <title>Plasmoids</title>
    <para>
      Plasmoids (also called Widgets) can be added by right-clicking the
      desktop and selecting Add Widgets…, which will bring up a list of
      Widgets. For more information, see

    <para>
      By right-clicking on the desktop once again, you can select Add
      Panel to get more panels. You can left-click the button on the far
      right side of the panel to alter the properties of the panel, like
      changing its height or width or adding Widgets, for example. For
      more information, see

    <title>Activities</title>
    <para>
      Activites are specific and exclusive to KDE. As such they’re often
      under utilised and misunderstood. In this section we’re going to
      explore what KDE Activities are, how to set them up, and how to
      use them.
    </para>
    <para>
      Think for a moment about your average day working on your PC. It
      will often traverse different activities. For example doing email
      and researching things on the internet, perhaps developing some
      documents, working on a piece of software, writing your thesis in
      LaTeX etc…
    </para>
    <para>
      Commonly KDE users might use Virtual desktops to seperate these
      workspaces.
    </para>
    <para>
      KDE Activites in Kubuntu provide a slick way to setup and
      configure environments specific to your task routines. For example
      your might want to have your email, and social networks configured
      as one activity. Perhaps your research, and writing for your
      thesis configured as another activity.

    <para>
      Let’s take a look at the default KDE Activities configured in
      Kubuntu. Right Click anywhere on the empty desktop and choose
      <quote>Activities</quote> from the menu. The Activities side bar
      appears on the left, with the Default activity. Notice the +
      Create Activity at the bottom. Click that, and lets created a new
      <quote>Social</quote> Activity. Enter <quote>Social</quote> as the
      Activity name: and then click Create.
    </para>
    <para>
      That’s it you have created your first activity.
    </para>
    <para>
      You can theme, and configured this new activity desktop in the
      same ways as mentioned early in this section of the manual.

      OK, looking good, lets create another activity. Call this one
      <quote>News</quote>. Once created switch to this activity, either
      by Right Click on the Desktop &gt; Activities or use the Keyboard
      shortcut Alt+D,A ( Hold Alt down, press D, then Press A ) Then
      select the News activity from the side bar.

        Dolphin is the default file manager in Kubuntu and can be
        compared with Windows Explorer. Dolphin looks simple because of
        great design, while having many powerful features. For more
        information, see

  <title>Updating</title>
  <para>
    Kubuntu developers release feature and security updates for
    applications and packages within the Kubuntu system. When updates
    become available, Kubuntu will display a message in the System Tray.
    To update the system, open Discover from either the Application Menu
    or Krunner and click the Update button (usually yellow/orange when
    there are updates). After installing some updates, it may be
    necessary to restart the computer. If so, Kubuntu will display a
    pop-up and an icon in the System Tray.
